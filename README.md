# Royal Harvest

> #### **Backstory**
>
> *Once upon a time, there was a knight from a Land Far, Far Away. He lived a peaceful life and did not stand out in any particular way. Although he stood by his kingdom, there were also times when he felt like dropping everything and becoming an ordinary worker. One day, after waking up, the knight saw a miracle. Suddenly, an **uncountable amount of fruits** began to fall from the sky. So he tried to catch them all!*
