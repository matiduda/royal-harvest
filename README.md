#### **Backstory**

> *Once upon a time, there was a Knight from a Land Far, Far Away. He defended The Kingdom where people lived a peaceful life. Recently, however, due to the drought, the people in The Kindgom have been starving. Then, one day, the Knight saw a true miracle - a start falling from the sky. Suddenly, an **unprecedented amount of food** began falling from the sky. So he began to catch as many of them as he could.*
